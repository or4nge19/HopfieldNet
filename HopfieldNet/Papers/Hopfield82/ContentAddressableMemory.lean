/-! ### Content-Addressable Memory Formalization -/

/--
The `HammingDistance` between two states measures the number of neurons with different activations.
This provides a metric for measuring the similarity between patterns.
-/
def HammingDistance (s₁ s₂ : PhaseSpacePoint R U) : ℕ :=
  card {i : U | s₁.act i ≠ s₂.act i}

/--
`PatternCompletionThreshold` is an empirically suggested maximum Hamming distance from a stored pattern
such that the network can still reliably retrieve the complete pattern.
The actual threshold for a specific CAM instance is part of the `ContentAddressableMemory` structure.

The paper suggests (p.2556): "For distance ≤ 5, the nearest state was reached more than
90% of the time" for a network of 30 neurons. This definition approximates that.

  Nat.floor (0.15 * (N : Real))

/--
A `ContentAddressableMemory` is a system that can retrieve a complete pattern
from a partial or corrupted version.

This formalizes the central concept from the paper (p.2554):
"A general content-addressable memory would be capable of retrieving this entire
memory item on the basis of sufficient partial information."

/-! ### Pattern Completion and Error Correction -/

/-- A generic function type representing how a metric (like completion probability or familiarity)
decays or changes based on a distance-like value and network size.
Parameters:
- `metric_value`: The input value to the decay function (e.g., distance from threshold, closest distance).
- `network_size`: The size of the network (e.g., `Fintype.card U`).
- `R`: The type for the output (e.g., probabilities).
Returns a value in `R`. -/
def MetricDecayFunction (R : Type) := (metric_value : ℕ) → (network_size : ℕ) → R

/--
A specific exponential decay model, often used to model probabilities or familiarity scores.
This corresponds to `exp(-value / (N/C))` where C is a constant (e.g., 10).
-/
noncomputable def ExponentialDecayMetric [Field R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R] [HDiv R R ℝ] [Coe ℝ R] : MetricDecayFunction R :=
  fun value network_size =>
    ((Real.exp (-((value : R) / ((network_size : R) / 10)))) : R)

/--
The `AbstractCompletionProbability` measures the likelihood of correctly completing a pattern
as a function of the Hamming distance `d` from the stored pattern, using a provided `decay_func`.

If `d` is within `cam.threshold`, probability is 1. Beyond that, it's determined by `decay_func`
applied to `d - cam.threshold`.
This formalizes the empirical finding from the paper (p.2556):
"For distance ≤ 5, the nearest state was reached more than 90% of the time.
Beyond that distance, the probability fell off smoothly."
The `ExponentialDecayMetric` can be used as `decay_func` to model this smooth fall-off.
-/
def AbstractCompletionProbability [Field R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R]
    (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) (p : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (d : ℕ)
    (decay_func : MetricDecayFunction R) : R :=
  if p ∈ cam.patterns then
    if d ≤ cam.threshold then 1
    else -- d > cam.threshold
      -- Since d > cam.threshold, d - cam.threshold is a well-defined natural number representing
      -- the distance beyond the threshold.
      let distance_beyond_threshold := d - cam.threshold
      decay_func distance_beyond_threshold (Fintype.card U)
  else 0

/-- `ErrorCorrection` quantifies the network's ability to correct errors in the input pattern.
It's measured as the reduction in Hamming distance to the closest stored pattern after convergence. -/
def ErrorCorrection (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U)
    (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) : ℕ :=
  let s' := HopfieldNet_stabilize cam.params s useq hf;
  let original_errors := Finset.min' (cam.patterns.image (fun p => HammingDistance s p)) (cam.patterns_nonempty.image (fun p => HammingDistance s p));
  let final_errors := Finset.min' (cam.patterns.image (fun p => HammingDistance s' p)) (cam.patterns_nonempty.image (fun p => HammingDistance s' p));
  original_errors - final_errors

/--
The `error_correction_guarantee` theorem establishes that Hopfield networks
can correct a substantial fraction of errors in the input pattern.

This formalizes a key capability of content-addressable memories.

  exact cam.completion_guarantee p hp s h_dist

/-! ### Basin of Attraction Analysis -/

/--
The `BasinOfAttraction'` of a pattern is the set of all states that converge to it.
This concept is central to understanding the storage and retrieval properties of Hopfield networks.

From the paper (p.2554): "Then, if the system is started sufficiently near any Xa,
as at X = Xa + Δ, it will proceed in time until X ≈ Xa."
-/
def BasinOfAttraction' (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) (p : PhaseSpacePoint R U)
    (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) : Set (PhaseSpacePoint R U) :=
  {s | HopfieldNet_stabilize cam.params s useq hf = p}

/--
The `BasinVolume` is the "size" of the basin of attraction, measured as the
fraction of the state space that converges to a given pattern.

This quantifies the robustness of memory retrieval.
-/
def BasinVolume [DecidableEq (PhaseSpacePoint R U)] (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) (p : PhaseSpacePoint R U)
    (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) : R :=
  let total_states := (2 : R) ^ (Fintype.card U);
  -- Use Finset.filter with a decidable predicate instead of trying to compute cardinality of a Set
  let all_states := @Finset.univ (PhaseSpacePoint R U) (inferInstance : Fintype (PhaseSpacePoint R U));
  let basin_states := (Finset.filter (fun s : PhaseSpacePoint R U =>
      HopfieldNet_stabilize cam.params s useq hf = p) all_states).card;
  (basin_states : R) / total_states

/--
The `basin_volume_bound` theorem establishes that the basin volume decreases
exponentially with the number of stored patterns.

This formalizes how memory capacity affects retrieval robustness.
-/
theorem basin_volume_bound (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) (p : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (hp : p ∈ cam.patterns)
    (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) :
  BasinVolume cam p useq hf ≥ (1 : R) / ((2 : R)^cam.patterns.card) := by
  sorry  -- Requires statistical analysis of basin volumes, likely combinatorial arguments about pattern distribution and overlap.

/-! ### Familiarity Recognition -/

/--
`AbstractFamiliarityMeasure` quantifies how familiar a given state `s` is to the network,
based on its proximity (closest Hamming distance) to stored patterns, using a provided `decay_func`.

The paper discusses (p.2557): "The state 00000... is always stable. For a threshold of 0, this
stable state is much higher in energy than the stored memory states and very seldom occurs."
A high familiarity measure (close to 1) indicates `s` is similar to a stored pattern.
The `ExponentialDecayMetric` can be used as `decay_func`.
-/
def AbstractFamiliarityMeasure [Field R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R]
    (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U)
    (decay_func : MetricDecayFunction R) : R :=
  let distances := cam.patterns.image (fun p_img => HammingDistance s p_img); -- Renamed p to p_img
  let closest_distance := Finset.min' distances (by
    rcases cam.patterns_nonempty with ⟨p_exist, hp_exist⟩
    use HammingDistance s p_exist
    apply Finset.mem_image.mpr
    exists p_exist
  );
  decay_func closest_distance (Fintype.card U)

/--
`IsFamiliar` determines whether a pattern should be recognized as familiar
based on a threshold familiarity measure, using a specific `decay_func` for the measure.
-/
def IsFamiliar [Field R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R]
    (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (threshold_val : R) -- Renamed threshold to threshold_val
    (decay_func : MetricDecayFunction R) : Prop :=
  AbstractFamiliarityMeasure cam s decay_func ≥ threshold_val

/--
The `familiarity_recognition` theorem establishes that the network can distinguish
between familiar and unfamiliar inputs. A pattern close to a stored one should be familiar.

This formalizes the paper's discussion (p.2557): "Adding a uniform threshold in
the algorithm is equivalent to raising the effective energy of the
stored memories compared to the 0000 state, and 0000 also
becomes a likely stable state. The 0000 state is then generated
by any initial state that does not resemble adequately closely
one of the assigned memories and represents positive recognition
that the starting state is not familiar."
-/

    (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U)
    (p : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (threshold_val : R) -- Renamed threshold to threshold_val

    (hp : p ∈ cam.patterns) :
  HammingDistance s p ≤ cam.threshold → IsFamiliar cam s threshold_val decay_func := by
  sorry  -- Requires analysis of AbstractFamiliarityMeasure's properties with the given decay_func.

/-! ### Category Formation and Generalization -/

/--
`CategoryRepresentative` identifies a pattern that represents a category
of similar patterns.

This formalizes the emergence of categories in Hopfield networks.
-/
noncomputable def CategoryRepresentative [DecidableEq (PhaseSpacePoint R U)]
    (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U)
    (category : Finset (PhaseSpacePoint R U))
    (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) : PhaseSpacePoint R U :=
  let representatives := cam.patterns.filter (fun p =>
                         ∀ s ∈ category, HopfieldNet_stabilize cam.params s useq hf = p);
  match representatives.toList with
  | [] => default  -- Using the Inhabited instance defined earlier
  | (p :: _) => p  -- Take the first element from the list

-- Helper function that turns equality of PhaseSpacePoints into a Bool
private def eqbPhaseSpacePoint {R U : Type}

    [DecidableEq (PhaseSpacePoint R U)] (x y : PhaseSpacePoint R U) : Bool :=
  if x = y then true else false

/--
`GeneralizationCapability` measures how many of the given categories
converge to a single pattern (i.e., a "correct generalization") using a
fixed update sequence `useq`. We count how many categories meet that
criterion, then divide by the total number of categories.

This avoids needing a `DecidablePred (λ c, ∃ p, ... )` by explicitly iterating
over finite lists and checking the condition constructively.
-/
noncomputable def GeneralizationCapability
  (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U)
  (categories : Finset (Finset (PhaseSpacePoint R U)))
  (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) : R :=
  let num_categories := categories.card
  let catList := categories.toList
  let correctCount := catList.foldl
    (fun acc c =>
      let cList := c.toList
      if cam.patterns.toList.any (fun p =>
         cList.all (fun s =>
           eqbPhaseSpacePoint (HopfieldNet_stabilize cam.params s useq hf) p))
      then acc + 1
      else acc)
    0
  (correctCount : R) / (num_categories : R)

def PatternSimilarity (p q : PhaseSpacePoint R U) : R :=
  (Fintype.card U - HammingDistance p q : ℕ)

/--
The `category_formation` theorem establishes that Hopfield networks naturally
form categories when presented with similar patterns.

This formalizes the emergent categorization property discussed in the paper.
-/
theorem category_formation (cam : ContentAddressableMemory R U) :
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ threshold_sim : R, ∀ p q : PhaseSpacePoint R U, -- Renamed threshold to threshold_sim

         PatternSimilarity q r / (Fintype.card U : R) > 1 - ε := by
  sorry  -- Requires analysis of category formation dynamics, potentially how Hebbian learning on similar patterns shapes the energy landscape.

/-! ### Temporal Sequence Memory -/

/--
`SequentialAttractor` represents a cyclic sequence of states that the network
can store and retrieve.

The paper briefly discusses (p.2557-2558): "Additional nonsymmetric terms which could be easily
generated by a minor modification of Hebb synapses ... were added to Tij. When A was judiciously adjusted, the
system would spend a while near Vs and then leave and go to a point
near Vs+1."

`SequenceRetrieval` tests whether the network can recall a sequence when given
one of its elements.-/

/--
The `sequence_memory_limit` theorem establishes that Hopfield networks with
standard Hebbian learning (or simple modifications for sequences) have limited capacity for storing sequential patterns.

The paper notes (p.2558): "But sequences longer than four states proved
impossible to generate, and even these were not faithfully
followed."-/
