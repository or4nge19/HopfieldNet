The `spin_glass_analogy` formalizes the connection between Hopfield networks and
physical spin glass systems, as discussed in the paper.

From the paper (p.2555): "This case is isomorphic with an Ising model."

/--
The `energy_convergence` theorem formalizes the connection between energy minimization
and the convergence to fixed points.

From the paper (p.2555): "State changes will continue until a least (local) E is reached."
